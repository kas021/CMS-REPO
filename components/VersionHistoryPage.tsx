                            <strong>FIX: Guaranteed Invoice Text Readability</strong> - Forced all text within the invoice body to a dark color, resolving a critical bug where text (such as headers) could become invisible if a light accent color was selected by the user. This ensures all invoices are always readable.

The "Balance Due" row now dynamically adjusts its text color (to black or white) to ensure high contrast against the user-selected accent color, fixing cases where white text appeared on a light-colored background.

                            <strong>STABILITY: Robust Date Calculation</strong> - Enhanced system stability by implementing a robust utility function (`parsePaymentTermDays`) for calculating invoice due dates from customer payment terms. This prevents date-related crashes from unexpected or malformed payment term data.

This provides a final layer of protection against blank screen errors and improves error logging.

                        <li>
                            <strong>FIX:</strong> The logic for calculating an invoice's due date is now robust and correctly handles all customer payment term formats, including "On Receipt", preventing the creation of invalid dates. This fix was applied to both the live application logic (`App.tsx`) and the mock data generation script (`large-mock-data.ts`) to ensure app stability.
