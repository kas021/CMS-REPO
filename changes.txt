File: utils/api.ts (NEW)
- Created a new file to manage and export a configurable `API_BASE_URL`.
- The URL is sourced from `localStorage.getItem('backend_url')` and defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.

File: components/LoginTabs.tsx
- Imported the new `API_BASE_URL`.
- Added a form at the bottom of the login screen to display and update the backend URL.
- On save, the new URL is stored in `localStorage` and the page is reloaded to apply the setting.

- Imported `API_BASE_URL`.
- Updated the `fetch` calls in the `BackupPanel` component for exporting and importing data to use the configurable `API_BASE_URL`.

  - `/backup/import` -> `${API_BASE_URL}/backup/import`

File: components/ProfilePage.tsx
- Imported `API_BASE_URL`.
- Updated commented-out example `fetch` calls in the API Keys panel to use the configurable `API_BASE_URL` and corrected the API path.
